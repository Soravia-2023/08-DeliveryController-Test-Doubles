# Writing Test with Tests Doubles

This Kata helps you to learn to differentiate the different "Test Doubles". The goal is to implement unit tests. You should name the identified test doubles according their type for example databaseStub.

Some hints
* Either use your favourite mocking framework or implement the double by your own
* Focus on the tests with Test Doubles i.e. don't implement tests without
